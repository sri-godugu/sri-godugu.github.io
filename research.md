## SenseRegen
**Deep Learning-Driven Perception for Multimodal Sensor Fusion in Challenging Weather**

SenseRegen is my PhD thesis framework aimed at improving autonomous perception under adverse weather conditions by combining camera, LiDAR, and radar with reliability-aware fusion and restoration-guided learning.

**Key ideas:**
- Weather-adaptive sensor weighting  
- Restoration-driven perception enhancement  

**Status:** Active PhD research

## Weather-Adaptive Sensor Prioritization (WASP)
A dynamic sensor weighting mechanism that emphasizes reliable sensing modalities when others degrade due to weather.

---

## Perceptual Restoration Networks (PRNet)
Deep learning models designed to reconstruct degraded sensor representations to support downstream perception tasks.
