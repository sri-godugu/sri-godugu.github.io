## About
I am a PhD researcher working on robust perception systems for autonomous vehicles under challenging weather conditions.  
My research focuses on fusing camera, LiDAR, and radar using deep learning architectures that adapt to sensor degradation and uncertainty.

## Research Themes
- Multimodal sensor fusion for autonomous perception  
- Reliability-aware and weather-adaptive fusion strategies  
- Sensor restoration and regeneration using deep learning  
- Multi-task perception with HydraNet-style architectures
